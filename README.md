# Meet PS Blender - A Revolution to blends

PS Blender is HTML-CEP based photoshop plugin which simulates the functionalities of the very known Adobe Illustrator's **Blend Tool**.

### Features

 Although the original blend tool is way too much complex to simulate in photoshop due to it's vector characteristics and no native references on how blends are being made, These are the features that is available now or may come later...
 
- [x]  Blend objects by changing **Positions**.
- [x]  Blend objects by changing **Size**.
- [x]  Blend objects by changing **Rotations**.
- [x]  Blend objects by changing **Transparency**.
- [x]  Blend objects by making **N** Steps.
- [ ]  Blend objects by keeping **N** Spacing.
- [ ]  Make blend follow the user defined **path**.
- [ ]  Reverse layer **stack order** of blend.

and so on.... The list may get updates as long as I get contributions by developers.

### Installation

* First of all download the latest [**Release**](https://github.com/Mr0nline/PS-Blender/releases) of PS Blender(.zxp).
* Plugin isn't currently available as custom installer so you need to install 3rd party software called [**ZXP Installer**](https://aescripts.com/learn/zxp-installer/) in order to install plugin automatically. Just install the ZXP Installer and open **PS Blender.zxp** in the Installer and it should now show you the confirmation dialogue to install. Click on confirm and restart your photoshop.
* Navigate to **Windows > Extensions > PS Blender** and now it should open the PS Blender.

If you're having any issues regarding installation kindly submit your issue on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/Mr0nline/PS-Blender/issues).

### Notes

This plugin is open source and any can contribute to make it even more better, I personally recommend that if you're HTML, CSS, JS familiar person then check on source code for few moments. You might end up on contributing to this amazing project.
